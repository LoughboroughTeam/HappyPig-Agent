## 1.Reading Sharing

**We will start the reading sharing from the first week 01/04/2025 ~ 06/04/2025. We will attempt to send everyone a paper (mostly from the LLM Agent course) to prepare a simple slids or other format you like for presentation. In the following 2 weeks (the 2nd and 3rd), we will arrange 2 papers for each team members and two reading sharing meetings in that week. [Here are some examples for prepared slids and docs.](https://github.com/s2029927szm/HappyPig-Agent/Sliedes_templates)
